# AINA &mdash; Medical landing page

This is the first item of the [AZ-Frontend-Challenge](https://github.com/rdnTheTrue/a-z-frontend-challenge).

Representing the letter A, AINA mean **life** in malagasy.

This frontend is heavily inspired by [Housemed](https://housemed.qodeinteractive.com/) theme, however it is not 100% accurately corresponding: components like the carousel slider on the top of the page or return to top button and more are missing in AINA.
